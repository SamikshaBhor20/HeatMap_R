# HeatMap_R
 A heatmap (aka heat map) depicts values for a main variable of interest across two axis variables as a grid of colored squares. The axis variables are divided into ranges like a bar chart or histogram, and each cellâ€™s color indicates the value of the main variable in the corresponding cell range.
 
 Interpretation:-
          Here we represent our normalized data with the help of heatmap. And it display expression level of multiple genes ona different sample. And here we see the different patterns depending upon the disease group sample or control sample. In our case it's ranging from -2 to 3 with varying color gradation
